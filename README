Pocket Command
==============

Copyright 2017 Alex King

Pocket command is a simple program to send a url to Pocket.  Pocket
(https://getpocket.com/) is a cloud service to queue up urls for later
reading.  Pocket is include in firefox, and has reader clients for common
portable devices.

Pocket command was written for Linux, but it should be simple to port to
other platforms.

When first run, or if pocket credentials have expired, it will try to
launch a firefox browser to allow you to log in to the pocket service.
Once done, it should add the url and save your credentials to disk for next
time.

I wrote this so I can save urls from thunderbird.

To install, just copy pocket.command.py to your path, (e.g. /usr/local/bin)
and make it executable.
